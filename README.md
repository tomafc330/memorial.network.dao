# memorial.network.dao

This is a DAO that will govern a digital graveyard that represent memorial sites for loved ones.

Introduction
=========
As the world moves towards digital, we need to embrace the idea that memories of loved ones should be stored online. With the advent of blockchain technology, we can now remember our loved ones through digital memorials, eternally.

Currently, a physical plot of land in a graveyard can cost upwards of $100,000 USD. In addition, the corpses are stored in a physical location which means itâ€™s hard for the kin and friends of the deceased to pay tribute because we live in a distributed world where families can be thousands of miles apart and thus it is not feasible nor practical to pay tribute to them in person.

The Solution
=========
Introducing Memorial.network, a metaverse of digital graveyards where people can store memories of their loved ones within digital plots of land. The project will distribute digital memorial plots and will include a directory / map of all the memorials on the website and each memorial can be url deep linked. The map of all the memorials will be shown graphically on the app. Within each memorial, there is information about the loved one, a space for family to upload pictures to IPFS (decentralized file storage), a space for family and friends to give condolences. In addition, others can support the family and kin by donating to them or to a charitable donation.

There will be an initial supply of 10,000 memorial plots only and they will be structured as NFTs. The unique advantage of owning memorial plots is that if a plot has not been used yet to host the memory of a loved one, they can lock up their plot of land (ie. stake) in exchange for earning MEM tokens. The MEM token is a utility token on the platform that will allow the governance of the project via voting rights. In addition, MEM tokens are used exclusively for the purchase of additional lands when they become minted.

The token holders of NEM can vote on various aspects of the DAO, including when to mint new memorial sites and the rate in which NEM tokens are being minted. The community will be the ones who will dictate the direction of the platform and any changes going forward.
